# RW_Conv

## Pre-implementing Stack of Convolution layers with RapidWright

This program consider three types of layers:
  1. Convolution
  2. Pooling Layer
  3. ReLU

Each layer is first implemented OOC with Vivado and a DCP is generated.

The program read each DCP and compose the architecture (_In progress_)
